# Universal Value Function Approximators

This repository contains an implementation of [[1](#1)]

The code is tested on a foor-room gridworld as in the paper. Only the supervised learning and the two-stage architecture is implemented.

Open notebook for explanation, and results.

To generate the dataset for learning the value function in a supervised way, run:
>> python lib/data.py [ouput]
